The sentence can be prolonged at a later date if he is deemed to remain a danger to society. \n\nHe will initially be kept isolated from other prisoners and currently occupies three cells, in \"compensation\" for being denied access to activities - including a bedroom, a study with a laptop and a fitness room.

The BBC travelled to western Nebraska and met some of those on the front line of a desperate standoff with mother nature. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19121807",
